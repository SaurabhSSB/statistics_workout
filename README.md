# 📊 statistics_workout

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that explore fundamental concepts in statistics using real-world datasets. These exercises cover techniques such as percentile-based filtering, Z-score calculations, modified Z-tests, and cosine similarity, enhanced with data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📁 Contents

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `1_percentile.py` | Calculates percentiles and removes outliers based on the 90th percentile of household size. |
| `2_mean_absolute_deviation_standard_deviation_z_value.py` | Performs outlier detection using standard deviation and Z-scores on BMI data. |
| `3_log.py` | Visualizes highway population data and introduces logarithmic plotting. |
| `4_Normal.py` | Plots income vs credit limit with log-scaled axes using Seaborn. |
| `5_cosine.py` | Demonstrates cosine similarity and cosine distance for basic NLP-like document vectors. |
| `6_modified_z_test.py` | Implements both standard Z-score and Modified Z-score methods for income-based outlier detection. |
| `modified_z_score.xlsx` | Example Excel sheet supporting the modified Z-score implementation. |
